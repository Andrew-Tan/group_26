    "In this project, we look at the relationship between movie's reviews and their IMDB scores (ranging from 0 ~ 5 stars). Positive reviews are often related to high IMDB scores, while negative reviews indicate the opposite. While it is easy for humans to understand a piece of review and guess the scores, we wonder if machines could understand it as well. Furthermore, we would like to automate this process, so that given a bunch of movie reviews, we are able to predict their corresponding IMDB scores easily. <br>\n",
