# Objectives
In this project we tend to build a Regression model that uses the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with RBF kernel algorithm to predict the rating of movies based on the review made. For this aim, we will be using a dataset called “Dataset_IMDB” from SentimentDictionaries library compiled by Nicolas Pröllochs and Stefan Feuerriegel Copyright © under the MIT License. Here is a direct link to the dataset which is sourced open in github.com.
The main objective of this study is to answer the following predictive question using our model:

“Given a review of a specific movie from one of the critics of the list below, what is the critic’s rating of the movie based on a number between 0 and 1?”

| Critics   |

| Dennis Schwartz |  
| James Berardinelli |   
| Scott Renshaw | 
| STEVE RHODES |
