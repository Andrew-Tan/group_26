# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
- For the DSCI 522 project, group 26 is committed to forming a friendly and effective team environment in which members are expected to learn, practice and accomplish project tasks. Aside from striving to finish academic goals, we hereby list a set of guidelines that gravitate us towards working as an ethical, respectful and coherent team. 

## Fundamental Guidelines
- This group is project-focused, therefore anyone's work should be evaluated solely based on its merit, rather than one's background 
- As tasks are equally and fairly distributed, every teammate has the right to express their opinions and suggestions 
- Teammates must be respectful and honest with each other, while being prompt and direct to ensure proper communication
- Absolutely no room for plagiarism

## Standards
- **Examples of positive behaviours include:**
	- Focus on what is best for the group as a whole
	- Being respectful and kind to teammates
	- Being humble and open-minded when accepting criticism from teammates
	- Thinking from teammates' perspective and provoke mutual understanding
	- Assisting others when they have troubles in a specific task

- **Examples of unacceptable behaviours include:**
	- Verbally insulting teammates under any circumstances
	- Dodging responsibilities and picking the easy way out to cause a burden on the rest of the teammate 
	- Copying others' work without permission and references
	- Judging others because their work is deemed unsatisfiable
	- Revealing unauthorized private information of others, such as their phone numbers, home addresses, etc

## Enforcement
Members who violated the code of conduct will be asked to stop the behaviour and are expected to comply immediately. If the member(s) continues to engage in activities violating this code of conduct, teach staff will be notified to impose corresponding consequences according to the school policy.
